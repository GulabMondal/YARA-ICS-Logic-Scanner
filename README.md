## üìñ Overview

This tool provides a lightweight, host-based method for detecting unauthorized logic manipulation in SCADA/ICS configuration files using [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/). It statically scans `.xml` project files exported from ModbusPal and similar simulators for malicious coil-write logic often used to alter PLC behavior.

## üß† Research Background

Modern ICS/SCADA environments are increasingly targeted by malware and logic manipulation attacks. This project demonstrates how **signature-based detection** (traditionally used in malware research) can be adapted for **logic-level validation** in industrial settings.

This repository complements the research paper titled:  
**‚ÄúSignature-Based Detection of Logic Manipulation in SCADA Systems Using YARA: A Lightweight Host-Level Approach‚Äù**
